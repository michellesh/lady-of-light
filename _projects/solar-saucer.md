A beloved flying saucer art car built by [Scotty Soltronic](https://www.scottysoltronic.com/). In 2021 we adorned it with about 1000 LEDs and built a wireless controller shaped like a mini-saucer. The art car is self-powered by six solar panels and has a DJ booth in the middle. Check out the video:
