The Playa Canop√©e, aka. "Betsy", is a ceiling of lights, under which one can cozy up on a bouncy chair and gaze up at the relaxing ebb and flow of lights. All ~650 LEDs are hand-soldered and controlled by custom code running on an Arduino. All the fabric components were lovingly sewn by [caprockthreadworks](https://www.instagram.com/caprockthreadworks/). Betsy first appeared at Burning Man 2019 at Camp Armageddon and has made an appearance at several other events since. This project was built as a part of [Salt Mind](https://www.instagram.com/saltmindslc/), an amazing group of humans.
