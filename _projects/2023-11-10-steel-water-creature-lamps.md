<h2>Shark</h2>

Freeform shark drilled in steel with a steel base. The custom walnut enclosure on the back is cut with a CNC router and houses all the wires and ESP32 board, and it includes a micro USB port for power. The LEDs shimmer to create the appearance of moving water.

<h2>Jellyfish</h2>

Again with a drill press, I freehanded 130 holes in a scrap piece of steel to make this cute little jelly. The jellyfish has a 3D printed enclosure to house the wires and ESP32 board. The twinkling is very subtle, but I coded it with the idea of looking through water at a jellyfish.
