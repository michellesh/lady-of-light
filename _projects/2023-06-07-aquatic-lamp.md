The structure was 3D modeled in Blender, followed by cutting out fish-shaped acrylic inserts and wood pockets using a CNC router. The facade was then hand-carved with a flowing, water-like texture, and the panels were assembled with hollow stainless steel rods, subtly concealing the wiring for a minimalist design. A custom-designed box, 3D printed with an integrated hinge and latch, houses the electrical components within the base of the lamp.
