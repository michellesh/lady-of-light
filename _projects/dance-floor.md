In it's truest form, the dance floor is a large shade structure for people to dance under! Four of the shade sails are striped with somewhere around 4800 LEDs. While dancing, you might spot a small fleeting treasure chest, which holds the secrets to customizing your dance experience! Contained within the treasure chest are a bunch of buttons and sliders that control the lights. This project was built as a part of [Salt Mind](https://www.instagram.com/saltmindslc/), a wonderful group of humans.
