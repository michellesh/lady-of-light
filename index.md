Hello! I'm Michelle! People also call me Micky.

I was previously a software engineer, and now I'm off pursuing creativity. Currently I'm learning about LEDs and posting about it here. I love code and art and combining them. For me, code is a form of art in itself!

Check out some of the [projects](/projects) I've worked on!
