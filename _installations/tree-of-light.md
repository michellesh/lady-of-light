A work in progress! The vision for the Tree of Light is an LED art installation designed to create a tree of colorful, moving, interactive light and life to the space between the forest floor and the canopy above.

We built a [4-foot tall prototype](/projects/tree-of-light-prototype) to start working on the code and light patterns before the larger structure is built.
