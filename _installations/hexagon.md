Have you ever wanted to walk INSIDE an infinity mirror? This is an infinity mirror meets walk-through hexagonal kaleidoscope! It made its first appearance at Electric Forest in 2024. Spanning 32 feet in length and standing 10 feet high, it features over 7,000 LEDs. A dedicated team of six constructed it from the ground up in just one week. Each light pattern is meticulously choreographed to the rhythm of ethereal music, amounting to an 18 minute loop of tracks from Interstellar, Stranger Things, and Tron.
