A fire-breathing dragon built with love by [Alex Gennett](https://alexgennettcreative.com/){:target="blank"}. I installed LEDs on the wings, belly, and eyes, and programmed several light patterns. There is also a wireless controller shaped like a dragon egg that I programmed to set the active light pattern and customize the color and speed.
